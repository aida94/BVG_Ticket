# BVG Ticket Suggestion

This is a React App that cames in help for Berlin visitor and citizen. You can answer some simple questions to get a better suggestion about tickets you may buy.</br>
Question are based in the main differences of the tickets, like duration, travel method, visiting zone, berlinpass holder.
I used React Hooks with typescript. For the design, I tried to keep the similar colors of the BVG Tickets site.
